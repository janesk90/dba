This document describes the suggested product and smart ratings systems.

Suggested Products:
	Go to a customer's order history and select five categories at random from their products purchased
	Select any five products which falls into at least one of those categories.
	
Smart Reviews: // the smart review is smarter when there is more cooperation from customers
	Customers are given the ability to rate revies as helpful or unhelpful
	All reviews start off assumed helpful because why would you leave a review you think is unhelpful? After all, it's a whole several precious minutes from your day.
	Normalize helpfulness to total votes ratio relative to the highest helpfulness score
	Find the weighted average by normalized helpfulness ratios
